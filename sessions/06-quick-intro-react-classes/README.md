# React Class Components

This section aims to provide just enough knowledge to get you started with React
components. If we are developing a new app, then we should be using React hooks
for state management and life-cycle.

## Resources

1. [Official documentation: State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).
2. [Official React.Component API](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).

This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br /> You will also see any lint errors
in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br /> It correctly bundles
React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br /> Your app is
ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.
