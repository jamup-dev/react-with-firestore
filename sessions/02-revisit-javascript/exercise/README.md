## Exercises

Exercises can be found inside `1`, `2`, `3` and `4` directories. Instructions
will be written as comments with the following legends

```js
// ðŸ§¸ - Implementation details / Guides.
// ðŸ’¡ - Tip.
// ðŸ’° - Additional tasks.
```

To get them started follow this process.

### Install dependencies

Make sure you are on the `exercise` directory.

```bash
cd sessions/02-revisit-javascript/exercise
```

Now install dependencies by running yarn.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Complete Task

Say we want to complete exercise for `1`.

From terminal (or git bash if on windows), run

```bash
yarn test:01
```

This will open the tests in watch mode. At this point all the tests will fail.

Now edit `1/start.js` file and complete the tasks. As you proceed the tests will
start passing and once you are done all the tests will pass.

Once done press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to quit the test watcher.

The finished exercise can be found under `1/end.js` of the `master` branch of
this repo.

Similarly when completing tasks for class 02, 03, 04 use the following commands

```bash
yarn test:02
yarn test:03
yarn test:04
```
